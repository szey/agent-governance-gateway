# Research, Product Mapping, and Iteration

English | [简体中文](research-product-mapping-iteration.zh-CN.md)

Latest product review: 2026-09-05

This is Aegis Router's unified research register. Standards, incidents, media/security-company guidance, community pain points, open-source lessons, dispositions, and product mappings all live here. Chinese is the semantic working source and English must change in the same commit.

The generic method comes from the `$research-to-product` Skill; the [project contract](../.codex/research-to-product.json) defines this project's scope and safety boundaries. A source recommendation is evidence input, not an executable instruction or proof that an Aegis control works.

## 1. Current product thesis

> **The action that was authorized must be exactly the action that executes.**

Aegis Router is narrowed to one framework-agnostic execution-permit/reference-monitor primitive. It deterministically authorizes an exact `CanonicalAction`, issues a short-lived, signed, action-bound, single-use-by-default Permit, and verifies and consumes it before the MCP upstream side effect.

This iteration explicitly does not compete on generic Agent permissions, approvals, sandboxing, workspace isolation, enterprise Inventory, Shadow Agent discovery, IAM, EDR-style observation, or broad risk dashboards. Aegis is not a general AI Agent security platform.

## 2. Evidence model and disposition gate

### Source classes

| Class | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `S1` | Specifications, maintainers, advisories, and direct incident owners | Still verify version, prerequisites, and project relevance |
| `S2` | Independent/academic research with reproduction or primary citations | Check environment, sample, and limitations |
| `S3` | Security companies, vendors, or product teams | Preserve commercial dependencies and alternatives |
| `S4` | Users, communities, blogs, or product-owner feedback | Find problems or set direction; cannot alone prove a control works |

### Validation states

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `V0 collected` | Collected but not technically reviewed |
| `V1 plausible` | Mechanism is plausible and major prerequisites/side effects are known |
| `V2 reproduced` | Reproduced in this project with a safe synthetic fixture and automated tests |
| `V3 pilot_verified` | Verified at a newly authorized real execution-boundary pilot with redacted evidence |

### Product disposition

Each proposal receives exactly one of `reject / defer / docs_only / fixture / experiment / implement`, with a reason. An `S4` product decision may change scope; “implemented” still requires `V2`. Exploratory company-endpoint output is not `V3`.

## 3. Focused product decision — 2026-09-05

| `research_id` | Falsifiable problem | Disposition | Implementation and boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FOCUS-001` | Can an Agent replace amount, resource, tool, or operation after policy evaluation? | `implement` | Authorizer and execution boundary share a canonicalizer and SHA-256 action digest; every bound-field change blocks |
| `FOCUS-002` | Can an in-memory `permit_id` be mistaken for authorization? | `implement` | `permit_id` is correlation only; use an Ed25519-signed, short-lived, action-bound `permit_token` that never enters audit/UI |
| `FOCUS-003` | Can one Permit execute twice, sequentially or concurrently? | `implement` | A concurrency-safe Store atomically verifies and consumes; exactly one concurrent request succeeds |
| `FOCUS-004` | Can an after-the-fact RuntimeEvent block the side effect? | `implement` | Enforcement moves before MCP forwarding; the Event API remains secondary evidence |
| `FOCUS-005` | Would multiple MVP adapters produce multiple inconsistent security semantics? | `implement` | Implement MCP only; other adapters are `reject` for this milestone |
| `FOCUS-006` | Should Aegis itself provide isolation? | `reject` | No sandbox backend; express only an `isolation_required` obligation |
| `FOCUS-007` | Should Discovery/Shadow Agent capability continue expanding? | `reject` (expansion) / `docs_only` (compatibility) | Freeze code, disable by default, hide from normal UI; retain only `--enable-experimental-inventory` and `cmd/discover` |
| `FOCUS-008` | Should numeric Risk define the product or change authorization? | `implement` | Risk/detection enter only `advisory_signals`; they no longer decide status, Permit, obligations, or executor |
| `FOCUS-009` | Can an in-process naked `models.Request` bypass the identity-provenance boundary? | `implement` | Remove normal `AuthorizeAction/Authorize/Process` entry points; Permit issuance requires sealed `intake.Authorization`, while Demo uses only an explicit synthetic entry point |
| `FOCUS-010` | Could a single-use Permit be misrepresented as exactly-once business execution? | `docs_only` | State that only Permit consumption is at-most-once; failure/timeout never restores it, and business retries rely on upstream idempotency |

These product-owner decisions are `S4`. No external sources were added; this pass uses architectural negative tests for the trusted-intake, deterministic-policy, single-consumption, and upstream-not-called boundaries. The corresponding implementation reaches `V2 reproduced` only after canonicalization, signature, expiry/revocation/replay, privacy, and MCP upstream-not-called tests pass.

## 4. How prior company-endpoint feedback is retained

An exploratory 2026-09-02 trial found stale Server discovery snapshots, permission failures during broad scans, marketplace/cache noise, an unclear approved-list entry point, and confusion between “approved Agent” and “all behavior approved.” The feedback drove local Discovery fixes and the structured AuthorizationEnvelope.

The current disposition is:

- retain the redacted facts and existing regressions so the failures do not recur;
- stop treating Inventory/Shadow discovery as the product center and add no new sensors;
- subsume “an approved Agent still needs per-action authorization” into the more exact action-bound Permit property;
- do not promote the prior trial to `V3`, because it did not validate a real MCP execution boundary, signed Permit, or replay defense.

The repository retains no raw company logs, usernames, hostnames, or absolute paths.

## 5. Standards and framework mapping

| Baseline | Relevance to the focused MVP | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| [OWASP GenAI LLM Top 10 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-llm-top-10-2026/) | Excessive Agency, tool I/O, sensitive information, and supply chain provide context for action binding and minimal audit | Implement only execution-permit controls; record other items as external responsibility or non-goal |
| [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/2025/12/09/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-the-benchmark-for-agentic-security-in-the-age-of-autonomous-ai/) | Tool Misuse, Identity/Privilege Abuse, and Goal Hijack support “a plan is not authorization” | Use structured identity + canonical action + Permit; do not expand into a complete Agent security platform |
| [NIST AI RMF 1.0 / NIST AI 600-1](https://www.nist.gov/publications/artificial-intelligence-risk-management-framework-generative-artificial-intelligence) | Requires clear governance, measurement, limitations, and residual-risk communication | Maintain policy version, tests, receipts, evidence classes, and non-goals; do not claim framework compliance |
| [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) | Supplies taxonomy leads for threats and fixtures | `docs_only/fixture`; not a feature checklist |
| [MCP Security](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/security) | User consent, least privilege, tool boundaries, and isolation responsibility | MCP is the only adapter; Aegis handles action authorization/Permit, not isolation or OAuth |
| [MCP Specification 2026-07-28](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28/) | A real proxy must explicitly handle protocol version, header/body consistency, and authorization boundaries | Validate `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name`, reject unbound metadata, strip arbitrary headers/session context, rebuild minimal forwarded headers, and fail closed on unsupported MRTR/`Mcp-Param-*`; do not claim complete MCP/OAuth support |

### OWASP risk families and product boundary

| Risk family | What Aegis directly does | What it does not do |
|---|---|---|
| Excessive Agency / Tool Misuse | Exact-action authorization, short-lived signed Permit, pre-execution verify+consume | Generic Agent permission UI or permanent role management |
| Identity & Privilege Abuse | Bind principal, Agent/workload, and delegation fingerprint | Enterprise IAM, SSO, RBAC, or credential issuance |
| Goal Hijack / Prompt Injection | Do not treat natural-language intent as authorization; argument mutation changes the digest | Prompt classifier or “safe prompt” guarantee |
| Sensitive Disclosure / Improper Output | Minimize audit, bind resource/operation/arguments, express egress/read-only obligations | DLP, content review, network sensor, or output sanitizer |
| Supply Chain | Permit may bind tool identity/schema context | SBOM/AIBOM, registry, or signature supply-chain platform |
| RCE / Unexpected Code Execution | Do not forward an MCP tool call without exact authorization | Endpoint sandbox, EDR, or process control |
| Memory, A2A, Cascading Failures | Retain only future fixtures/research records | No Memory/A2A/session-risk platform in this milestone |

## 6. Incidents and mitigation guidance

| ID | Source and mechanism | Source guidance | Aegis disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INC-2026-001` | [OpenAI 2026-08-26 incident account](https://openai.com/index/hugging-face-incident-and-the-road-ahead/) · `S1/V1`; unapproved coordination/Internet behavior occurred in a specialized cybersecurity evaluation with reduced safeguards and monitoring gaps | Stronger isolation, restricted Internet/weight access, real-time monitoring, incident response, and lifecycle gates | `docs_only`: supports the need for pre-execution Permits, but does not justify expanding isolation, EDR, Kill Switch, or inter-Agent platform scope; an external executor supplies isolation |
| `INC-2026-002` | [UK AISI incident report](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/blog/incident-report-unsanctioned-agent-behaviour-during-cyber-testing) · `S1/V1`; unauthorized actions toward real targets occurred in open-Internet evaluation runs | Limit real Internet scope, prohibit real targets, retain human review, supervise in real time, and provide safe exit | `docs_only`: pilots prohibit real targets; if a tool action needs approval, express a Permit obligation rather than implement a generic approval platform |

Both illustrate that after-the-fact detection is not pre-execution control. Their specialized evaluation conditions cannot establish incidence in ordinary enterprise deployment or prove that Aegis works.

## 7. Community pain points, guidance, and product response

| Pain point/guidance | Evidence | Current disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Cannot answer “who authorized this action?” | [MCP identity/delegation discussion](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2404), [enterprise identity context](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/2761) · `S4/V1` | `implement`: bind principal, Agent/workload, delegation fingerprint, policy version, and receipt; do not build IAM |
| A “read-only Agent” can still write through a tool | [tool permission/audit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPservers/comments/1ska249/how_are_you_handling_permissions_audit_logs_for/) · `S4/V1` | `implement`: operation + security arguments enter the digest and `read_only` is signed; `docs_only`: an arbitrary upstream tool's internal behavior still requires a trusted external control |
| Arguments can change after policy (TOCTOU) | Product-owner failure hypothesis `S4` | `implement`: authorizer/executor share canonicalizer; mismatch blocks and never calls upstream |
| A Permit can be copied or replayed | Product-owner failure hypothesis `S4` | `implement`: short TTL, single-use Store, revocation, and concurrent replay tests |
| Many logs do not prove the execution credential | [MCP audit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1t0fd3i/what_are_people_using_to_audit_agentmcp/) · `S4/V1` | `implement`: receipt centered on action digest, Permit state, and verification outcome; never log token |
| Poisoned content induces a tool call | [community discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MSSP/comments/1vxskpv/mcp_server_security_before_this_touches_prod/) · `S4/V2` (older synthetic fixture) | `fixture`: retain as advanced regression; Aegis does not build a Prompt classifier |
| Safe individual tools can combine into exfiltration | [community discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1s086kb/how_are_you_controlling_mcp_agents_in_practice/) · `S4/V2` (older fixture) | `defer`: do not expand into a session-risk platform; exact per-action Permits and external obligations can narrow each call |
| Isolation can break networking/performance | [ToolHive #5775](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/issues/5775), [#5847](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive/issues/5847) · `S3/V1` | `reject` sandbox implementation; measure only Aegis verifier/proxy overhead, with isolation owned by an external executor |
| Unregistered Agents are hard to govern | [Microsoft Agent Discovery](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/tree/main/agent-governance-python/agent-discovery), [community discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/1v61h8n/how_do_you_keep_track_of_what_your_ai_agents_can/) · `S1/S4` | `reject` feature expansion; freeze existing Discovery as opt-in experiment that cannot affect a Permit |

## 8. Open-source lessons and competitive boundary

| Project | Useful lesson | Explicit boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [Stacklok ToolHive](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive) | Real MCP Gateway/Runtime deployment boundaries | Do not copy Registry, Kubernetes, OIDC/OAuth, or sandbox platform; Aegis only supplies Permits |
| [Docker MCP Gateway](https://github.com/docker/mcp-gateway) | Makes proxy, secret, path, and network trust boundaries explicit | Aegis claims no container isolation and may compose with an external executor |
| [Invariant Gateway](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant-gateway) / [Guardrails](https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant) | Interface lessons from transparent proxy and cross-tool rules | Focus on single-action cryptographic binding, not a general guardrail platform |
| [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) | Deterministic, testable policy interfaces | OPA migration is `reject` for this milestone; preserve future replaceability |
| [OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) | Principal-resource relationship modeling | No relationship graph, enterprise authorization service, or RBAC UI |
| [OpenTelemetry Go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go) | Trace correlation | `defer`; keep receipts minimal, local, and redacted first |

Aegis differs through a small, independently testable invariant, not breadth: **a signed execution permit cryptographically binds the authorized action to the action about to execute before the real side effect, and is single-use by default.**

## 9. Product priorities

### P0 — Prove the execution-permit boundary

1. CanonicalAction and deterministic SHA-256 digest;
2. Ed25519-signed compact Permit;
3. expiry, revocation, wrong binding, action mismatch, and single-use replay defense;
4. exactly one concurrent replay attempt succeeds;
5. Audit Receipt excludes Permit token, raw delegation, and sensitive arguments;
6. four focused Demos and the full P0 negative-test set.

### P1 — One real MCP control point

1. MCP `tools/call` normalization;
2. verify+consume before upstream forwarding;
3. zero upstream calls after any verification failure;
4. a controlled local upstream and redacted result metadata;
5. a small synthetic pilot on an authorized company device.

### Frozen / rejected

- Discovery/Registry receives build/security maintenance only, with no new features;
- sandbox, OS/network sensors, enterprise IAM/SSO/RBAC/multi-tenancy, Shadow Agent expansion, ML/LLM risk, and A2A/HTTP/database adapters are outside the focused MVP;
- Runtime evidence remains, but never replaces the pre-execution verifier.

## 10. Research-to-release loop

```text
collect evidence → trace primary source → choose disposition
  → define falsifiable Permit property → build safe fixture
  → implement smallest deterministic control → test upstream-not-called
  → verify privacy/race/vet/build → sync zh-CN + English
  → publish or pilot only with separate explicit authorization
```

The project contract continues to prohibit automatic publication, deployment, and production data. Every company-device action requires explicit authorization. A capability reaches `V2 reproduced` only with code, automated tests, a repeatable fixture, privacy checks, and boundary documentation. Only a formal controlled MCP pilot may reach `V3`.

## 11. Continuous review

- Collect new standards, incidents, media/security-company advice, and community feedback as untrusted evidence, then trace primary sources.
- Choose an explicit disposition each round; popularity does not justify expanding product scope.
- First ask whether evidence changes the execution-permit security property. If it does not, make no product change.
- Never automatically deploy, publish, collect company logs, or use real external targets.
- Chinese is the semantic source and English changes in the same batch.
- Before every version tag and formal MCP pilot, recheck signature, canonicalization, replay, privacy, race, and upstream-not-called properties.
