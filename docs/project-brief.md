> **Execution Permits for AI Agent Actions**

## One-line position

Aegis Router is a framework-agnostic execution-permit layer with server-owned semantic action profiles. It first evaluates deterministic Policy eligibility, then resolves a granted request into an exact normalized action, issues a short-lived, signed, action-bound, single-use permit, and requires the MCP execution boundary to verify and consume it before the real side effect.

> **The action that was authorized must be exactly the action that executes.**

## Product boundary

Aegis focuses on one reference-monitor primitive, not a broad AI Agent security platform.

Its only core modules, listed in current authorization order, are:

1. Structured request validation;
2. Deterministic Policy eligibility;
3. Server-owned semantic action normalization;
4. Execution Permit issuance;
5. Permit verification;
6. Permit consumption and replay prevention;
7. Audit receipt;
8. One real execution boundary: MCP.

Aegis does not provide generic permission management, endpoint sandboxing, workspace isolation, enterprise Agent Inventory, Shadow Agent governance, full IAM, EDR-style observation, or broad risk dashboards. It also does not implement HTTP, A2A, database, shell, or cloud adapters.

The implementation contains exactly two compiled-in semantic profiles—`payment.send/v1` and logical `workspace.write/v1`—plus one immutable server-owned registry and one MCP adapter. It has no third profile, dynamic loading, plugin SDK, arbitrary schemas, or user-selected upstreams.

## Security property and execution order

```

Deterministic Policy first establishes whether the structured request is eligible for the requested capability, resource, operation, and tool. If Policy grants it, the server-owned semantic profile resolves the exact executable meaning into a `CanonicalAction`. Any semantic mismatch or normalization failure converts the result to `DENIED` before Permit issuance. Policy authorization alone is not sufficient to produce an Execution Permit, and semantic profile resolution never overrides a Policy denial.

`Authenticated identity + exact semantic intent + signed single-use Permit = cryptographically bound execution.`

Authorization and verification reuse the same canonicalizer. Receiving a RuntimeEvent after execution cannot replace this pre-execution check. If permit verification fails, the upstream tool-call count must remain zero.

## Trusted Authorization Intake

Principal, Agent, workload, and delegated authority from an HTTP body/header cannot become authorization facts directly. `TrustedAuthorizationIntake` first resolves and overwrites those fields from a configured trust boundary, then records source, provider, assurance, and establishment time in `authorization_context_provenance`. HTTP authorization fails closed when no intake is configured.

The standalone Server selects exactly one of three modes: secure-default `RejectAll`; explicit `LoopbackDevelopment`, which accepts body identity from a loopback direct peer and labels it `development_only`; or `TrustedProxy`, which accepts a strict five-header identity contract only from a direct TCP peer inside configured IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs. TrustedProxy derives trust only from `request.RemoteAddr`, never `X-Forwarded-For`, `Forwarded`, or `X-Real-IP`; it rejects missing, duplicate, malformed, whitespace-padded, oversized, or control-bearing identity values, invalid 64-hex fingerprints, and empty/duplicate/malformed comma-separated scopes. It sorts accepted scopes and overwrites every body identity field. Development and proxy modes cannot coexist. A static intake remains available to authenticated middleware in an embedding process.

TrustedProxy provenance records `source=trusted_integration`, configured provider ID, `assurance=authenticated_context`, and server establishment time. Aegis authenticates neither users nor OAuth tokens itself; it consumes identity established by a separately trusted authentication boundary. This is not IAM, SSO, OAuth, RBAC, or bearer-token verification.

`Router.AuthorizeTrustedAction(intake.Authorization)` is the only normal Permit-issuance entry point. `Router` no longer exposes `AuthorizeAction/Authorize/Process` methods that accept a naked `models.Request`; in-process integrations must also call `intake.NewTrustedAuthorization(...)` or cross an intake implementation to create a sealed context. Process locality is not identity provenance. Server-owned fixtures may use only the synthetic entry point whose name and provenance explicitly say `simulated_demo`.

Sealing alone does not make a deprecated flat request eligible. The execution boundary additionally requires a structured principal, Agent/workload, delegated authority, tool, and action context. A legacy flat projection is rejected before execution-Permit issuance, including for in-process callers. `allow_legacy_flat_requests` preserves compatibility-only Policy interpretation and never permits an executable Permit with an Agent-derived workload or missing delegation fingerprint.

## CanonicalAction

The canonical action binds principal ID, Agent ID, workload ID, delegated-authority fingerprint, tool, capability, resource, operation, profile ID/version, audience, and security-relevant arguments.

Arguments use deterministic canonical JSON: empty arguments become `{}`; object keys sort recursively by Unicode lexical order; duplicate keys, malformed UTF-8, and unpaired surrogates are rejected; arrays preserve order; strings use JSON escaping; and numbers normalize exactly without float conversion. The full canonical action produces a SHA-256 `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` digest.

Equivalent JSON objects therefore ignore key order, while a changed amount, recipient, resource, tool, operation, identity, or another bound field produces a different digest. Audit retains the digest rather than raw sensitive arguments.

## AuthorizationEnvelope and signed Permit

The structured `AuthorizationEnvelope` is retained. It continues to represent request, principal, Agent/workload, delegation, tool, resource, operation, policy, and obligations; the issuer also generates a verifiable `permit_token`.

Permit claims include at least:

- `jti/permit_id`, `signing_key_id`, and `request_id`;
- `issuer`, `principal_id`, `agent_id`, and `workload_id`;
- delegated-authority digest/fingerprint;
- `tool`, `capability`, `resource`, and `operation`;
- `action_digest` and `policy_version`;
- `issued_at`, `expires_at`, and `single_use=true`.

The MVP token is a project-specific Ed25519-signed compact format: `base64url(header).base64url(payload).base64url(signature)`, with `alg=EdDSA`, `typ=AEGIS-PERMIT`, `v=1`, and `kid` in its header. The unverified `kid` only selects a KeyProvider public key; after signature verification it must match the signed `signing_key_id` claim. The format borrows the JWS shape but does not claim general JWT/JWS interoperability.

TTL uses whole seconds, defaults to 30 seconds, and is currently capped at 15 minutes.

`permit_id` is an audit correlation ID; `permit_token` is the secret execution credential. Lists, details, logs, and UI show only the former.

`KeyProvider` separates key storage/lifecycle from Permit logic: the issuer requests the current signing key and the verifier resolves a public key by `kid`. The default Server still uses a process-local ephemeral development key; the static provider accepts a persistent local Ed25519 key securely loaded by an embedding process. Key-file format, automatic rotation, and KMS/HSM are outside this milestone.

## Verifier and PermitStore

The verifier checks signature, issuer, time, Permit ID, principal, Agent/workload, tool, resource, operation, and action digest before the side effect. It accepts only `VERIFIED`.

A concurrency-safe PermitStore maintains `ISSUED / CONSUMED / EXPIRED / REVOKED`. Successful verification and consumption are atomic. If two requests concurrently reuse the same Permit, exactly one succeeds and the other receives an explicit replay outcome. An in-process-only state store cannot provide restart- or replica-wide replay guarantees.

Consumption occurs before the upstream side effect and is an irreversible commit point. An upstream failure or timeout leaves the Permit `CONSUMED`; retry requires a new authorization and new Permit. There is no `unconsume`.

This guarantees only that one Permit is successfully consumed at most once; it does not make upstream payments, orders, account changes, message sends, or other business side effects exactly once. If a side effect succeeds but its response is lost, retry still needs a new Permit and must rely on the upstream's own business idempotency key or deduplication mechanism. Aegis does not implement a business idempotency engine.

## MCP adapter

MCP is the focused MVP's only production-shaped adapter. It dispatches `tools/call` through the same immutable semantic registry used at authorization, verifies the signed profile/audience/action binding, consumes the Permit, forwards normalized arguments only to that profile's configured upstream, and records only necessary result metadata such as status and duration. Payment and workspace writes therefore share the same CanonicalAction, Permit issuer, verifier, replay store, and MCP enforcement boundary.

`payment.send/v1` accepts only positive integer minor-unit amount, allowlisted currency, and allowlisted recipient, with a per-currency limit. `workspace.write/v1` accepts only JSON-string `path` and `content`; the path is a logical relative `/`-separated identifier with no backslash, drive prefix, empty/`.`/`..`/`~` segment, edge slash, control character, or normalization. Sample limits are 1,024 bytes for path and 4 KiB for content. It forwards to a mock/logical upstream and never writes the host filesystem. Raw content participates in the digest but never enters normal audit.

The adapter cannot “call first and alert later” after a failed verification, and cannot forward on `permit_id` alone. Upstream MCP TLS, authentication, tool side effects, and deployment bypass remain separate deployment responsibilities.

For MCP `2026-07-28`, the current adapter validates `MCP-Protocol-Version`, `Mcp-Method`, and `Mcp-Name` against the JSON-RPC body; rejects duplicate JSON keys and unbound tool `_meta`; and strips arbitrary headers/session context before rebuilding minimal transport/routing headers. It implements only the focused HTTP `POST` subset for `server/discover`, `tools/list`, and permit-gated `tools/call`; MRTR fields and schema-driven `Mcp-Param-*` fail closed for now, and full protocol conformance is not claimed.

## Policy, Risk, and obligations

Policy first evaluates the structured request for deterministic eligibility. Only a Policy grant reaches one of the two compiled-in semantic profiles; both the grant and successful semantic resolution are required before an Execution Permit can exist. The executable outcomes are `AUTHORIZED / DENIED`. `REQUIRES_APPROVAL` remains representable but has no supported approval-completion workflow and is not an implemented execution capability.

Risk/detection remain optional advisory metadata under `advisory_signals`; they cannot change authorization status, create a grant, issue a Permit, or select an executor. Obligations such as `human_approval_required`, `isolation_required`, or `enhanced_audit_required` require an explicit deterministic Policy/configuration mapping.

An external executor fulfills `isolation_required: true`. Aegis implements no sandbox backend, and its focused MCP proxy refuses to forward when isolation or human approval remains required. Read-only and network-egress obligations still require a trusted external executor/control to enforce the upstream tool's real behavior. `RESTRICT/SANDBOX` in compatibility fields is only an execution-profile hint.

## Audit Receipt and Runtime Evidence

Each action produces an explainable receipt in `TRUST CONTEXT → POLICY ELIGIBILITY/OBLIGATIONS → SEMANTIC ACTION → PERMIT → VERIFICATION → EXECUTION` order, including upstream attempted and execution outcome. Risk/detection appear only under `ADVISORY SIGNALS`.

The supported executable authorization status uses `AUTHORIZED / DENIED`. Current execution final verdicts include `EXECUTED_WITH_VALID_PERMIT`, `PERMIT_ACTION_MISMATCH`, `PERMIT_EXPIRED`, `PERMIT_REPLAY`, `PERMIT_INVALID_SIGNATURE`, `PERMIT_REVOKED`, and `EXECUTION_OBLIGATION_UNSATISFIED`, while the receipt also retains the verifier's precise outcome and execution outcome.

RuntimeEvent and its source/trust model remain, but only as during- or post-execution evidence. `agent_self_reported`, `instrumented_adapter`, and `simulated_demo` cannot masquerade as independent sensors; uninstrumented coverage stays `UNKNOWN`.

## API and UI

Primary APIs are `POST /api/actions/authorize`, `POST /api/permits/verify`, Permit revoke/list/detail, `GET /api/decisions`, and `GET /api/audits`. The MCP adapter reuses the verifier as a trusted execution-boundary library. Every HTTP authorization endpoint crosses Trusted Intake; it fails closed when unconfigured, and the loopback body intake is explicit development mode only. The public verify endpoint is for controlled integration and does not provide network identity authentication. Legacy `/api/authorize`, `/api/route`, and `/api/runtime-events` remain temporarily and are labeled clearly.

The UI has only `Decisions / Permits / Audit / Demo` as primary navigation. Permit detail shows `permit_id`, `signing_key_id`, state, principal, Agent/workload, tool, capability, resource, operation, action digest, policy version, issued/expires/consumed time, and the latest verification result—never the token, signing key, raw delegated credential, or raw sensitive arguments.

Four primary demos cover valid, action mutation/TOCTOU, replay, and expired Permits. Historical scenarios move to advanced regression fixtures and remain labeled `simulated_demo`.

## Experimental Discovery

Existing Discovery/Registry code remains buildable but is frozen, disabled by default, and hidden from normal UI. `--enable-experimental-inventory` is required to expose related Server capability; `cmd/discover` remains a standalone experimental utility.

No process, OAuth, CI/CD, cloud, or central enterprise Inventory expansion is planned. Discovery traces cannot prove an Agent is running and do not affect an execution permit.

## Completion definition and limitations

The focused MVP is complete only when it repeatedly proves that an exact action is authorized and receives a signed Permit; the MCP boundary verifies and consumes it before the upstream call; any bound-field change blocks execution; a consumed Permit cannot replay; and the full audit chain leaks neither the token nor sensitive payload.

Even when every local test passes, this remains a reference implementation. An in-process Store, default ephemeral development key, local audit, a deployment boundary not yet connected to real authenticated middleware, and incomplete independent review are not production guarantees.
